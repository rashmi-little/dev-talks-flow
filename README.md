# DEVTALKS - A Developer Community Platform

## Introduction

Imagine you’re a developer, working late into the night, trying to solve a bug that’s preventing your application from running. You’ve spent hours scouring through logs, Googling error messages, and debugging every line of code, but you just can’t figure out what’s going wrong. The frustration builds as you realize that the problem is a small configuration error or something you simply missed—like trying to run an image before starting the Docker engine or an application occupying a port that you didn’t know about.

As a fresher, you might face these challenges often, and getting help immediately isn’t always possible. That’s where **DEVTALKS** comes in—a dedicated platform for developers, where they can ask questions, share solutions, and collaborate with peers and experts to solve real-world development problems.

## Purpose

DEVTALKS is a community-driven website designed to help developers, especially freshers, navigate the challenges of programming and debugging. The platform allows users to ask questions about issues they are facing, and receive answers from the community. The questions can be tagged with specific technical problems, and users can rate, upvote, and downvote answers to ensure that the best solutions rise to the top.

## Features

### 1. **Search Functionality**

A search bar will be prominently available throughout the website, allowing users to search for questions, answers, or users based on specific **tags**, **keywords**, or **usernames**. This helps users quickly find relevant information and solutions.

### 2. **Home Page - Question List**

The home page will feature a dynamic list of questions with various filters, such as:
- **Newly Added**: Recent questions posted by users.
- **Unanswered**: Questions that have not yet received a response.
- **Popular**: Questions with a high number of views or upvotes.

Users can browse these lists to discover problems that others are facing, or to find solutions to issues similar to theirs.

### 3. **Question Detail Page**

When a user clicks on a specific question, they’ll be taken to a detailed page that includes:
- The **question** itself.
- A list of **answers** provided by the community.
- A **text box** for users to provide their own answers and contribute to the discussion.

### 4. **Star Mark Questions**

To help users save important questions, we’ll have a **star mark** feature. This allows users to “star” a question, which will then be saved in their **Collections** for future reference. It’s perfect for questions that might not be urgent now, but could be useful later.

### 5. **Upvote/Downvote System**

Similar to platforms like StackOverflow, we’ll have an **upvote and downvote** system where users can rate answers based on their usefulness. The most helpful answers will rise to the top, ensuring that the best solutions are easy to find.

### 6. **Community Section**

The **Community** section will list all users in the platform. Users can view other people's profiles, see the questions they’ve asked, and check their contributions to the community. This helps foster connections and encourages knowledge sharing among users.

### 7. **Tags**

Every question posted will be associated with one or more **tags**. These tags will help categorize the questions by technology, problem type, or other relevant criteria. Users can click on a tag to view a list of questions related to that tag.

- Tags will also include a **description** to guide users about what kind of questions belong to that tag. For example, a tag like "Docker" could have a description explaining that it’s for questions related to containerization.

### 8. **Collections**

The **Collections** feature allows users to view all the questions they’ve starred. This feature will act like a personal library of important or useful questions and answers, enabling users to refer back to them whenever needed.

### 9. **Profile Page**

Each user will have their own **Profile Page**, which includes:
- **Basic Information**: When they joined, their position, and a short description of themselves.
- **Statistics**: The number of questions asked, the number of answers provided, and the user’s overall activity on the platform.
- **Question & Answer History**: A record of all the questions they’ve asked and answered.

### 10. **Ask a Question**

Users will be able to post their own questions on the platform. When asking a question, users can:
- Provide a **detailed description** of the issue they’re facing.
- Include **code blocks** or snippets to illustrate their problem.
- Add relevant **tags** to categorize their question.

### 11. **Basic Authentication**

To ensure only registered users can ask questions, provide answers, or vote, we will have a simple **login/logout** system. Users can create accounts, log in, and start participating in the community.

### 12. **Legend Role for Moderators**

The **Legend** role is a special user role that gives select members the ability to moderate the platform. Legends can:
- Delete inappropriate or incorrect questions and answers.
- Manage users, including banning spammers or other malicious users.
- Ensure that the platform remains a helpful and respectful environment for everyone.
